Pickup place Optimization Project

The project aims to find the best location for a parcel pick-up facility that minimizes total travel time (one way to the pick-up point) for people in the top 10 neighbourhoods with the most people in Atlanta.
We use the haversine distance and driving distance to find the addresses.
The information of these neighbourhoods as follows:
